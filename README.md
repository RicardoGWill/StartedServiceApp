# StartedServiceApp
This app introduces a "Started Service".  There is a button to start a service "TheService" and another button to stop the service. There is a Toast given when each is done.  If the service is not stopped, it will continue.  All services need an "onBind" method, but in this case, it is "null" because it is a "Started Service", not a "Bound Service".  (OnClickListeners are done through "onClick" in XML.)  I also created an inner class called "TheThread" within "TheService" class.  "TheThread" allows things to occur after the Service has started.  If there were no threads, then I would not be able to type or do anything after the Service started except stop the Service.  Note that this app is not the best solution, and IntentService App shows how to better implement things.
